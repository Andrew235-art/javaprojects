2. Write code for Using ArrayList to Store and Display Elements (5 Marks)
An ArrayList is a resizable array, part of the List interface in the Java Collections Framework. (5 Marks)
3. Show how to use a HashSet to store unique elements and how to handle duplicates. (5 Marks)
4. Show how to use a HashMap to store key-value pairs and access them. (5 Marks)
5. Create a Generic Method. A generic method allows us to create a method that can work with any data type. (5 Marks)

Note: Upload your code to the GitHub.Follow me to see ur code. Best Regards.
Here is the skills.
ArrayList: Dynamic arrays for storing elements.
HashSet: Unique, unordered collection.
HashMap: Key-value pairs for mapping data.
Generic Class: Flexible class that can handle any type safely.
Generic Method: Reusable methods that work with different types without typecasting.

These MCQs cover the core topics from the Basics of Java, environment setup, writing first programs,Syntax, data types, and input/output operations,Conditional and looping statements.
, Methods, functions, and recursion of your Java course, helping students review key concepts.
